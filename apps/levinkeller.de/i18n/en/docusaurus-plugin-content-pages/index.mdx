      <h1>Levin's Homepage</h1>
      Welcome to my homepage. This site is being developed lean, so there are still
      few contents and many things are incomplete or aesthetically not consistent.
      Additionally, this site allows me to play around a bit with NextJS and MDX,
      which is interesting.
